# Global-Temperatures-Forecast

Abstract

This time series analysis is to look at the effects of climate change, by forecasting for future average global temperature for any given city. The data was selected from Kaggle containing 239,177 observations and six variables representing different cities, countries, and temperatures. ‘AverageTemperature’, ‘AverageTemperatureUncertainty’, ‘City’, ‘Country’, ‘Longitude’, and ‘Latitude’.  The objective of this analysis is to  build a forecasting model that can help predict global temperature changes among different major cities in the world. In order to understand the time series and forecast temperature, the analysis was performed on a single city; Mexico City. Two separate models were performed on this data, both a SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and a Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) model.  Between the two, the SARIMA model provided an RMSE of  8.96 and the SES model an RMSE of 7.66. After a detailed analysis of the dataset, the SES model is the better method for forecasting global average temperatures. Future discussion explains in further details of the data itself. 
Keywords: AverageTemperature, AverageTemperatureUncertainty, City, Country, Longitude, Latitude.
